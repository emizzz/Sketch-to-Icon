# Sketch-to-icon

## Project
In this project a Convolutional Neural Network is used for the feature extraction task.

The implemented model ignore the gap between draws and icons, instead resolves it with a simple Edge Extraction.

## Other Experiments
I'm working also in order to bridge the gap between the domains, check my python repo: 
https://github.com/emizzz/Sketch-to-Icon-Paper-Code.

## Icons
Icons are (the free) part of the beautiful [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) dataset. This project use more than 1500 icons.

## Dataset
The model was trained on a subset of the famous [QuickDraw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) dataset.
